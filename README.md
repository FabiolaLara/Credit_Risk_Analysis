# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Using Algorithms like: randomOverSample, SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEEN

# Overview of the analysis:

For this Challenge we analyze different kind of algorithms in order to see the difference between their results, then we can analyze their outputs by printing final reports to analyze which analyes retrieves an optimal value to determine the accuracy, precision, and sensitivity in those methos, we can also see others values refering to F1 which involves precision and sensitivity at the sme time so we can have a better information while analyzing data.


# Results:

* **Naive Random Oversampling** ***balanced accuracy score:*** 0.6398437216722869 or 63%.

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. Use screenshots of your outputs to support your results.



# Summary: Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. If you do not recommend any of the models, justify your reasoning.
